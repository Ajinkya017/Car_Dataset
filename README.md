# Car_Dataset
Scraped data of used cars listings. 100,000 listings, which have been separated into files corresponding to each car manufacturer. The collected data is used to make a tool to predict how much a person should sell his old car for compared to other stuff on the market, and then just extended the data set. Then made a more general car value regression model

This dataset is the modified version of 100,000 UK Used Car Data set. The dataset consist of combined used car information of 7 brands namely Audi, BMW, Skoda, Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota and Hyundai.

The number of rows is 72435. 
The number of columns is 10. 

This is a cleaned Dataset which includes price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, road tax, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size information. Ideas for expanding this dataset, innovative visualizations, and a variety of other ways to manipulate this dataset are all welcome.

Happy Coding!
