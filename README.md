# Car_Dataset
Scraped data of used cars listings. 100,000 listings, which have been separated into files corresponding to each car manufacturer. The collected data is used to make a tool to predict how much a person should sell his old car for compared to other stuff on the market, and then just extended the data set. Then made a more general car value regression model
